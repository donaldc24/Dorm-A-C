# Dorm-A-C
Used 6 120mm fans and Arduino to create a thermostat to help control the temperature of my dorm room.

During the winter time up in Iowa our dorms are set to a very high heat with no way to control the temperature, and if you leave fan on with window open it gets very cold, very quickly. My solution, use an Arduino to measure the temperature and allow me to set what I want my temperature to be with an IR senor with remote. Then the Arduino turns on/off the fans accordingly to regulate the temperature.
